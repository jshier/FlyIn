        "html": "<p>Vultee BT-13 owned by the Women Air Force Service Pilots (WASP) Museum.</p><p>History comes to life through legendary wartime aircraft during Warbirds in Review sessions, which delve into aircraft restoration and operation and spotlight veterans sharing stories about what it was like to fly in combat or provide ground support. Presentations take place at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. daily, July 24-29 on the Warbirds in Review ramp in Warbird Alley. The schedule also includes daily demonstrations at 9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. from the Warbirds Living History Group on flight gear associated with the upcoming aircraft. Next, vocalist Theresa Eaman will entertain the crowds with tunes from the 1940&#39;s through the 1960&#39;s. Several Warbirds in Review presentations will be followed by book signing opportunities in the Warbirds Merchandise Building.</p><p>&ldquo;July 2017 marks the 15th Anniversary of Warbirds in Review&rdquo; said Connie Bowlin, EAA Warbirds of America president and Warbirds in Review program founder. &ldquo;As I look back on the modest beginning thinking of Tex Hill, Bud Anderson, Robin Olds, Gunther Rall, Shorty Rankin, and so many other World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War, Afghanistan and current military veterans who have been a part of Warbirds in Review, it is humbling. What began with a simple idea, with a boom box and roll around stairs, to offer a time when people could come to hear an owner talk about their aircraft has become a truly world class program. With David Hartman as the writer and moderator, the award winning production crew of Sleeping Dog Productions, the support of Jim Hagedorn, Scotts Miracle Gro Company, Warbird members Ron and Diane Fagen, numerous other donors and the total support of aircraft owners, pilot and ground crew members, we have grown to a level beyond all expectations. The live streaming of Warbirds in Review in 2016 was viewed in 64 countries. &nbsp;For me personally it is a little overwhelming to know that we have entertained and shared our history with the world. &nbsp;With Jumbotron, bleachers, sound systems, worldwide live streaming and the participation of so many terrific Warbird members the evolution has exceeded all expectations.&rdquo;</p><p>BT-13 &ndash; WASP &ndash; In 1942, as the country reeled from the attack on Pearl Harbor, trained male pilots were in short supply. Qualified pilots were needed to fight the war. Twenty-eight experienced civilian women pilots volunteered to take the job of ferrying aircraft. They formed the country&rsquo;s first female squadron in late summer 1942. In 2017 the American Aviation Heritage Foundation donated a beautiful, newly restored BT-13 to the WASP museum. This BT-13, from start to finish, was intended for donation to the WASP to be flown in tribute to their service. &nbsp;That is impressive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The Paradigm Aerobatic Team will be performing as well, expanding on their successful appearance at Oshkosh last year.</p><p>After the STOL flying and Paradigm performance, Twilight Flight Fest still has more left to offer. Guests can expect to see skydiving or other events well suited for the dimming light, demos by fixed wing ultralights and light sport aircraft, gyroplanes, powered parachutes, and 3D RC flying.</p><p>The Twilight Flight Fest will provide attendees with an up-close look other forms of aviation, and should offer a fun and fresh perspective to any and all crowd members.</p>",

        "html": "<p>Republic P-47 Thunderbolt featuring D-Day pilot Deke Holman.</p><p>History comes to life through legendary wartime aircraft during Warbirds in Review sessions, which delve into aircraft restoration and operation and spotlight veterans sharing stories about what it was like to fly in combat or provide ground support. Presentations take place at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. daily, July 24-29 on the Warbirds in Review ramp in Warbird Alley. The schedule also includes daily demonstrations at 9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. from the Warbirds Living History Group on flight gear associated with the upcoming aircraft. Next, vocalist Theresa Eaman will entertain the crowds with tunes from the 1940&#39;s through the 1960&#39;s. Several Warbirds in Review presentations will be followed by book signing opportunities in the Warbirds Merchandise Building.</p><p>&ldquo;July 2017 marks the 15th Anniversary of Warbirds in Review&rdquo; said Connie Bowlin, EAA Warbirds of America president and Warbirds in Review program founder. &ldquo;As I look back on the modest beginning thinking of Tex Hill, Bud Anderson, Robin Olds, Gunther Rall, Shorty Rankin, and so many other World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War, Afghanistan and current military veterans who have been a part of Warbirds in Review, it is humbling. What began with a simple idea, with a boom box and roll around stairs, to offer a time when people could come to hear an owner talk about their aircraft has become a truly world class program. With David Hartman as the writer and moderator, the award winning production crew of Sleeping Dog Productions, the support of Jim Hagedorn, Scotts Miracle Gro Company, Warbird members Ron and Diane Fagen, numerous other donors and the total support of aircraft owners, pilot and ground crew members, we have grown to a level beyond all expectations. The live streaming of Warbirds in Review in 2016 was viewed in 64 countries. &nbsp;For me personally it is a little overwhelming to know that we have entertained and shared our history with the world. &nbsp;With Jumbotron, bleachers, sound systems, worldwide live streaming and the participation of so many terrific Warbird members the evolution has exceeded all expectations.&rdquo;</p><p>P- 47 &ldquo;Thunderbolt&rdquo; &ndash; &nbsp;Deke Holman served during World War II as a C-47 copilot on D-Day, later transitioning to the P-47. He retired from United Airlines flying the B-747 so he says he has always flown 47s. The two P-47s that will be on display are owned by John Shoffner and Neal Melton. Deke Holman was part of the air show red shirt team for many years and is a very special friend to many Oshkosh volunteers. It will be fun to recognize Deke&rsquo;s service while learning about the P-47.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Bud Anderson.&nbsp;</p><p>History comes to life through legendary wartime aircraft during Warbirds in Review sessions, which delve into aircraft restoration and operation and spotlight veterans sharing stories about what it was like to fly in combat or provide ground support. Presentations take place at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. daily, July 24-29 on the Warbirds in Review ramp in Warbird Alley. The schedule also includes daily demonstrations at 9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. from the Warbirds Living History Group on flight gear associated with the upcoming aircraft. Next, vocalist Theresa Eaman will entertain the crowds with tunes from the 1940&#39;s through the 1960&#39;s. Several Warbirds in Review presentations will be followed by book signing opportunities in the Warbirds Merchandise Building.</p><p>&ldquo;July 2017 marks the 15th Anniversary of Warbirds in Review&rdquo; said Connie Bowlin, EAA Warbirds of America president and Warbirds in Review program founder. &ldquo;As I look back on the modest beginning thinking of Tex Hill, Bud Anderson, Robin Olds, Gunther Rall, Shorty Rankin, and so many other World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War, Afghanistan and current military veterans who have been a part of Warbirds in Review, it is humbling. What began with a simple idea, with a boom box and roll around stairs, to offer a time when people could come to hear an owner talk about their aircraft has become a truly world class program. With David Hartman as the writer and moderator, the award winning production crew of Sleeping Dog Productions, the support of Jim Hagedorn, Scotts Miracle Gro Company, Warbird members Ron and Diane Fagen, numerous other donors and the total support of aircraft owners, pilot and ground crew members, we have grown to a level beyond all expectations. The live streaming of Warbirds in Review in 2016 was viewed in 64 countries. &nbsp;For me personally it is a little overwhelming to know that we have entertained and shared our history with the world. &nbsp;With Jumbotron, bleachers, sound systems, worldwide live streaming and the participation of so many terrific Warbird members the evolution has exceeded all expectations.&rdquo;</p><p>P-51 &ldquo;Old Crow&rdquo; &ndash; It would be difficult to find a veteran who is more respected and admired than Col C.E. &ldquo;Bud&rdquo; Anderson or two aircraft owners who have been more involved in warbird history and preservation than Jack Roush and Jim Hagedorn. Col Anderson is the one veteran who has been a part of Warbirds in Review in all of the 15 years. Welcome back Bud, Jack and Jim &ndash; we all love hearing your stories and appreciate you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Even the Wright brothers were homebuilders, since they didn&rsquo;t rely on a factory to construct their airplanes.

A significant number of homebuilt aircraft have flown around the globe and one, the Voyager in 1986, was the first airplane ever to fly around the world non-stop on a single tank of fuel.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 9px; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;\">EAA was founded in 1953 by a group of airplane enthusiasts mostly comprised of airplane builders, although anyone with an aviation interest has always been welcome in the organization. EAA has been the organization of record as the homebuilt movement moved from simple, single-place tube-and-fabric airplanes 60 years ago to today's wide spectrum of aircraft that feature plans- and kit-built models. No matter the airplane project, one thing remains constant &ndash; homebuilt aircraft provide a path where nearly anyone can pursue their personal dream of flight.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 9px; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;\">EAA's extensive resources, available through the EAA members' area or the association's staff, can help any aircraft builder or restorer to create a safe, efficient aircraft that provides recreation and education.</p>",

Existing FAA pilot licensing requirements do not require a demonstration of proficiency beyond 60 degrees of bank, and recovery only from rudimentary stalls, or approach to stalls. Unexpected upsets encountered in actual accidents can require pilot skills beyond standard licensing capabilities, which is why international authorities have recommended Upset Prevention and Recovery Training (UPRT) prior to commercial licensing for all pilots worldwide. Find out what comprehensive UPRT entails, what it will teach you that standard licensing training will not, and how it can make you a safer and more confident pilot on every flight you make.

Presentations take place at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. daily, July 24-29 on the Warbirds in Review ramp in Warbird Alley. The schedule also includes daily demonstrations at 9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. from the Warbirds Living History Group on flight gear associated with the upcoming aircraft. Next, vocalist Theresa Eaman will entertain the crowds with tunes from the 1940&#39;s through the 1960&#39;s. Several Warbirds in Review presentations will be followed by book signing opportunities in the Warbirds Merchandise Building.</p><p>&ldquo;July 2017 marks the 15th Anniversary of Warbirds in Review&rdquo; said Connie Bowlin, EAA Warbirds of America president and Warbirds in Review program founder. &ldquo;As I look back on the modest beginning thinking of Tex Hill, Bud Anderson, Robin Olds, Gunther Rall, Shorty Rankin, and so many other World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War, Afghanistan and current military veterans who have been a part of Warbirds in Review, it is humbling. What began with a simple idea, with a boom box and roll around stairs, to offer a time when people could come to hear an owner talk about their aircraft has become a truly world class program. With David Hartman as the writer and moderator, the award winning production crew of Sleeping Dog Productions, the support of Jim Hagedorn, Scotts Miracle Gro Company, Warbird members Ron and Diane Fagen, numerous other donors and the total support of aircraft owners, pilot and ground crew members, we have grown to a level beyond all expectations. The live streaming of Warbirds in Review in 2016 was viewed in 64 countries. &nbsp;For me personally it is a little overwhelming to know that we have entertained and shared our history with the world. &nbsp;With Jumbotron, bleachers, sound systems, worldwide live streaming and the participation of so many terrific Warbird members the evolution has exceeded all expectations.&rdquo;</p><p>F-89 &ndash; Dick Rutan &ndash; The F-89 was deployed over much of the northern hemisphere, including USAF bases in Iceland, Greenland, and the continental US. This unsung hero of the Cold War served as the first line of defense against the Soviet bomber threat for many years, until replaced by aircraft such as the F-102 and F-106 in the 1960s. Given Dick&rsquo;s enthusiasm and charismatic speaking style, this is sure to be one of the highlights of this year&rsquo;s schedule.</p>",

        "html": "<p>Ed Robertson, the lead singer of the multi-platinum band&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.barenakedladies.com/\">Barenaked Ladies</a>, distinctly remembers when he discovered he wanted to be a pilot.</p><p>&ldquo;My uncle flew a (Cessna) 185 on straight floats,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He took my older brother and I fishing once &hellip; I was hooked.&rdquo;</p><p>The now-avid pilot will get to combine his passions of flying and music at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh 2017 as Robertson and the band will headline the always-anticipated opening night concert on Monday, July 24, immediately following the afternoon air show. The concert is once again presented by Ford Motor Company.</p><p>After his first flight, Robertson&rsquo;s aviation dream sat for a while until his wife gave him a ground school course as a 30th birthday gift. Now, flying is as important in his life as music.</p><p>&ldquo;What really appeals to me is the precision of it, the learning and the intellectual demands,&rdquo; said Robertson, who flew a Cessna 206 amphibian for many years before selling it and now flies a G-1000 Cessna 182 on wheels. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun and challenging to push yourself to learn new things. I&rsquo;m in a rock band so my entire adult life has been focused on creativity. Pushing myself to do my instrument rating was really satisfying.&rdquo;</p><p>And then, of course, there&rsquo;s the cool stuff about flying. Robertson has worked extensively with the Canadian military and even acted as an Honorary Colonel for 424 Squadron Search and Rescue. That&rsquo;s allowed him to pilot C-130s, Hornets, and even Gryphons (although he admits he&rsquo;s &ldquo;a terrible rotary pilot&rdquo;).</p><p>Floatplane flying, though, is where Robertson finds true joy.</p><p>&ldquo;The flexibility and rugged beauty of float flying is like nothing else,&rdquo; the Canadian-born singer said. &ldquo;Outside of Toronto, you don&rsquo;t have to go very far at all to where it may as well be 1930. It&rsquo;s just lakes and rocks and trees forever. It&rsquo;s truly a beautiful experience to fly up there.&rdquo;</p><p>Barenaked Ladies bring a set to Oshkosh that is well-known, fun, and infectious. Among the band&rsquo;s biggest hits are &ldquo;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmHI0r57BA8\">One Week</a>,&rdquo; which reached No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard chart, as well as instantly recognizable hits such as &ldquo;If I Had $1,000,000&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pinch Me.&rdquo; The group has received numerous Billboard Music Awards, Grammy nominations and Juno Awards (Canada&rsquo;s equivalent of the Grammys). One of the band&rsquo;s most recognized songs is the theme song from the top-rated CBS comedy &ldquo;The Big Bang Theory.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ford is proud to be a partner with EAA and we try to bring memorable experiences to the visitors at AirVenture,&rdquo; said Edsel B. Ford II, member of the Ford Motor Company board of directors. &ldquo;Since 2006, Ford has been proud to bring top-notch entertainment to AirVenture and provide fun for everyone who joins us at Oshkosh. We&rsquo;re very much looking forward to the great hits of Barenaked Ladies on opening night!&rdquo;</p><p>Just as with pilot and singer Dierks Bentley, who played the AirVenture opening night concert in 2015, aviation will have a special connection when Robertson and Barenaked Ladies take the stage on July 24. It&rsquo;s a one-of-a-kind Oshkosh moment for the singer.</p><p>&ldquo;It means I&rsquo;ll finally be able to make it to the show!&rdquo; Robertson said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always working during AirVenture. I look forward to taking it all in. Happy flying, everybody, and keep the dirty side down!&rdquo;</p>",

Many IFR pilots have a poor understanding of the requirements, procedures and best practices necessary to confidently plan an instrument departure particularly when there are obstacle departure procedures published. In this seminar, we will show you how to do this confidently and safely. By reviewing scenarios and examples of challenging departures, you will learn about diverse departures, ODPs, SIDS and more. We&rsquo;ll also discuss how to anticipate and deal with emergencies that might arise in the early phase of an instrument flight.

Presentations take place at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. daily, July 24-29 on the Warbirds in Review ramp in Warbird Alley. The schedule also includes daily demonstrations at 9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. from the Warbirds Living History Group on flight gear associated with the upcoming aircraft. Next, vocalist Theresa Eaman will entertain the crowds with tunes from the 1940&#39;s through the 1960&#39;s. Several Warbirds in Review presentations will be followed by book signing opportunities in the Warbirds Merchandise Building.</p><p>&ldquo;July 2017 marks the 15th Anniversary of Warbirds in Review&rdquo; said Connie Bowlin, EAA Warbirds of America president and Warbirds in Review program founder. &ldquo;As I look back on the modest beginning thinking of Tex Hill, Bud Anderson, Robin Olds, Gunther Rall, Shorty Rankin, and so many other World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War, Afghanistan and current military veterans who have been a part of Warbirds in Review, it is humbling. What began with a simple idea, with a boom box and roll around stairs, to offer a time when people could come to hear an owner talk about their aircraft has become a truly world class program. With David Hartman as the writer and moderator, the award winning production crew of Sleeping Dog Productions, the support of Jim Hagedorn, Scotts Miracle Gro Company, Warbird members Ron and Diane Fagen, numerous other donors and the total support of aircraft owners, pilot and ground crew members, we have grown to a level beyond all expectations. The live streaming of Warbirds in Review in 2016 was viewed in 64 countries. &nbsp;For me personally it is a little overwhelming to know that we have entertained and shared our history with the world. &nbsp;With Jumbotron, bleachers, sound systems, worldwide live streaming and the participation of so many terrific Warbird members the evolution has exceeded all expectations.&rdquo;</p><p>A-20 &ndash; Lewis Air Legends, Rod Lewis &ndash; On 15 July, 2015, test pilot Stewart &ldquo;Stew&rdquo; Dawson gently pulled back on the control yoke and made aviation history as a Douglas A-20 Havoc took to the air for the first time in nearly a quarter-century. Impeccably restored by Aero Trader at Chino Airport, California, the aircraft is A-20G 43-21709. When the A-20 arrived in Oshkosh mid May 2017 we had a good laugh with Stew &ndash; it was either the last Warbird to arrive for Airventure 2016 or the first to arrive for 2017. It is a pleasure to, once again, welcome Rod Lewis and thank him for his commitment to the preservation of so many wonderful warbirds.</p>",

Presentations take place at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. daily, July 24-29 on the Warbirds in Review ramp in Warbird Alley. The schedule also includes daily demonstrations at 9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. from the Warbirds Living History Group on flight gear associated with the upcoming aircraft. Next, vocalist Theresa Eaman will entertain the crowds with tunes from the 1940&#39;s through the 1960&#39;s. Several Warbirds in Review presentations will be followed by book signing opportunities in the Warbirds Merchandise Building.</p><p>&ldquo;July 2017 marks the 15th Anniversary of Warbirds in Review&rdquo; said Connie Bowlin, EAA Warbirds of America president and Warbirds in Review program founder. &ldquo;As I look back on the modest beginning thinking of Tex Hill, Bud Anderson, Robin Olds, Gunther Rall, Shorty Rankin, and so many other World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War, Afghanistan and current military veterans who have been a part of Warbirds in Review, it is humbling. What began with a simple idea, with a boom box and roll around stairs, to offer a time when people could come to hear an owner talk about their aircraft has become a truly world class program. With David Hartman as the writer and moderator, the award winning production crew of Sleeping Dog Productions, the support of Jim Hagedorn, Scotts Miracle Gro Company, Warbird members Ron and Diane Fagen, numerous other donors and the total support of aircraft owners, pilot and ground crew members, we have grown to a level beyond all expectations. The live streaming of Warbirds in Review in 2016 was viewed in 64 countries. &nbsp;For me personally it is a little overwhelming to know that we have entertained and shared our history with the world. &nbsp;With Jumbotron, bleachers, sound systems, worldwide live streaming and the participation of so many terrific Warbird members the evolution has exceeded all expectations.&rdquo;</p><p>F8F Bearcat and Blue Angel F-18 &ndash; John O&rsquo;Conner is the owner of the beautiful F8F Bearcat painted in the Blue Angel scheme. &nbsp;We are confident that the Blue Angels will be a part of this presentation with one of the demo team pilots and the F-18 but that is subject to change. Regardless, this will be a tribute to the Navy featuring the F8F Bearcat.</p>",

Presentations take place at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. daily, July 24-29 on the Warbirds in Review ramp in Warbird Alley. The schedule also includes daily demonstrations at 9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. from the Warbirds Living History Group on flight gear associated with the upcoming aircraft. Next, vocalist Theresa Eaman will entertain the crowds with tunes from the 1940&#39;s through the 1960&#39;s. Several Warbirds in Review presentations will be followed by book signing opportunities in the Warbirds Merchandise Building.</p><p>&ldquo;July 2017 marks the 15th Anniversary of Warbirds in Review&rdquo; said Connie Bowlin, EAA Warbirds of America president and Warbirds in Review program founder. &ldquo;As I look back on the modest beginning thinking of Tex Hill, Bud Anderson, Robin Olds, Gunther Rall, Shorty Rankin, and so many other World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War, Afghanistan and current military veterans who have been a part of Warbirds in Review, it is humbling. What began with a simple idea, with a boom box and roll around stairs, to offer a time when people could come to hear an owner talk about their aircraft has become a truly world class program. With David Hartman as the writer and moderator, the award winning production crew of Sleeping Dog Productions, the support of Jim Hagedorn, Scotts Miracle Gro Company, Warbird members Ron and Diane Fagen, numerous other donors and the total support of aircraft owners, pilot and ground crew members, we have grown to a level beyond all expectations. The live streaming of Warbirds in Review in 2016 was viewed in 64 countries. &nbsp;For me personally it is a little overwhelming to know that we have entertained and shared our history with the world. &nbsp;With Jumbotron, bleachers, sound systems, worldwide live streaming and the participation of so many terrific Warbird members the evolution has exceeded all expectations.&rdquo;</p><p>T-34, SNJ4 &ndash; Frank Borman and Jim Lovell &nbsp;These two gentlemen are best known as Apollo Astronauts but they flew real airplanes before they entered Space travel. Following on the heels of a Friday night program at Theatre in the Woods, the Warbirds in Review audience will have the opportunity to be up close and personal. You may even see a couple more Apollo Astronauts in the audience. The SNJ4, representing the aircraft they flew in training is owned by Fagen Fighters World War II museum. The featured T-34 is owned and flown by Frank Borman.</p><p></p>",

To see it fly, to hear the roar of the engine and the whistling of the wind over the wings, and, most of all, to fly or even just ride in a warbird is a history lesson brought to life in the most exhilarating way imaginable. That experience reminds us of the sacrifices made by veterans who flew these aircraft in combat in order for us to enjoy the freedoms &mdash; not to mention the aircraft &mdash; we take for granted today.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 9px; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;\">Whether you fly, restore, or simply enjoy warbirds and their place in history, we invite you to consider adding Warbirds of America to your EAA membership.</p>",

        "html": "<p><em>World Airshow News</em>&nbsp;has announced that Kyle Franklin is the 2017 recipient of the Bill Barber Award for Showmanship. One of the most prestigious awards in the airshow industry, the list of Barber honorees reads like an airshow hall of fame. Kyle is a second-generation airshow pilot and a second-generation Bill Barber Award winner. His father, Jimmy Franklin, started flying airshows in 1967, was the recipient of the 1989 Bill Barber Award, and is one of the true legends of the airshow business. Jimmy and Kyle are the second father and son to receive the Bill Barber Award. Bobby Younkin (2004) and his son Matt (2012) were the first.</p><p>Kyle naturally grew up around airshows and began flying the family&rsquo;s Super Cub when he was only eight years old. At age 14, he began wing-walking for fun, and in 1997 began his professional airshow career when he started wing-walking on his dad&rsquo;s Waco Mystery Ship. He transitioned his wing-walking to the famous Franklin Jet Waco a few years later, making him the first jet wing-walker. Kyle also began working on his low level aerobatic card and began flying an occasional comedy routine in the Franklin&rsquo;s Super Cub and an aerobatic act in one of the family Wacos.</p><p>Sadly, a July 2005 airshow accident claimed the life of his father, but Kyle knew he wanted to stay in the airshow business. He continued the Super Cub comedy act and motorcycle-to-airplane transfer, and in 2008, he brought back the Franklin Waco Mystery Ship, creating&nbsp;<em>Pirated Skies</em>, a Waco aerobatic act built around a pirate theme, complete with Kyle in full pirate garb. In 2009, he added wing-walking to&nbsp;<em>Pirated Skies</em>.</p><p>In 2013, Kyle introduced&nbsp;<em>Dracula</em>, a custom-designed, custom-built, one-of-a-kind biplane powered by a 500 horsepower Pratt &amp; Whitney R985 that evokes the lines and sound of a Waco, while being smaller and more maneuverable like modern high-performance aerobatic aircraft. He built his act around a vampire theme, with unique costumes and storyline. Today, Kyle offers the Cub comedy act, the motorcycle-to-airplane transfer, and&nbsp;<em>Dracula</em>&nbsp;to airshows from coast-to-coast.</p><p>The Bill Barber Award for Showmanship began in 1986, and is awarded to airshow performers or teams that have demonstrated great skill and showmanship.&nbsp;<em>World Airshow News</em>&nbsp;magazine and the friends and family of the late Bill Barber present the award annually.</p><p>The Bill Barber Award for Showmanship will be presented on Tuesday evening, July 25 during EAA AirVenture at EAA&rsquo;s Theater in the Woods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Past Bill Barber Award winners include:</p><p>2016 Manfred Radius</p><p>2015 Bob Carlton &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2000 John Mohr</p><p>2014 Greg Koontz &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1999 Dan Buchanan</p><p>2013 Skip Stewart &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1998 Patty Wagstaff</p><p>2012 Matt Younkin &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1997 Gene Soucy &amp; Teresa Stokes</p><p>2011 Rich and Dee Gibson &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1996 Wayne Handley</p><p>2010 Steve Oliver and Suzanne Asbury-Oliver &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1995 Bob Hoover</p><p>2009 Michael Goulian &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1994 Bob &amp; Annette Hosking</p><p>2008 Bud Granley &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1993 Red Baron Stearman Squadron</p><p>2007 Dacy Family Airshow Team &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1992 Sean D.

Presentations take place at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. daily, July 24-29 on the Warbirds in Review ramp in Warbird Alley. The schedule also includes daily demonstrations at 9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. from the Warbirds Living History Group on flight gear associated with the upcoming aircraft. Next, vocalist Theresa Eaman will entertain the crowds with tunes from the 1940&#39;s through the 1960&#39;s. Several Warbirds in Review presentations will be followed by book signing opportunities in the Warbirds Merchandise Building.</p><p>&ldquo;July 2017 marks the 15th Anniversary of Warbirds in Review&rdquo; said Connie Bowlin, EAA Warbirds of America president and Warbirds in Review program founder. &ldquo;As I look back on the modest beginning thinking of Tex Hill, Bud Anderson, Robin Olds, Gunther Rall, Shorty Rankin, and so many other World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War, Afghanistan and current military veterans who have been a part of Warbirds in Review, it is humbling. What began with a simple idea, with a boom box and roll around stairs, to offer a time when people could come to hear an owner talk about their aircraft has become a truly world class program. With David Hartman as the writer and moderator, the award winning production crew of Sleeping Dog Productions, the support of Jim Hagedorn, Scotts Miracle Gro Company, Warbird members Ron and Diane Fagen, numerous other donors and the total support of aircraft owners, pilot and ground crew members, we have grown to a level beyond all expectations. The live streaming of Warbirds in Review in 2016 was viewed in 64 countries. &nbsp;For me personally it is a little overwhelming to know that we have entertained and shared our history with the world. &nbsp;With Jumbotron, bleachers, sound systems, worldwide live streaming and the participation of so many terrific Warbird members the evolution has exceeded all expectations.&rdquo;</p><p>P-63, T-38 &ndash; Joe Engle &ndash; this Bell P-63, owned by the Dixie Wing of the CAF, was operated by the NACA (predecessor of NASA). Having the NASA T-38 as part of this program completes the circle to tell the history of NASA. Retired General Joe Engle was associated with NASA from the X-15 to Apollo through the Shuttle and is the perfect person to share its history. He is the only person to have flown two different types of winged vehicles in space; the X-15 and the Space Shuttle. He is also the only astronaut to have manually flown the Shuttle through re-entry and landing. The Dixie Wing is working to have other P-39s and P-63s join the presentation.</p>",

Presentations take place at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. daily, July 24-29 on the Warbirds in Review ramp in Warbird Alley. The schedule also includes daily demonstrations at 9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. from the Warbirds Living History Group on flight gear associated with the upcoming aircraft. Next, vocalist Theresa Eaman will entertain the crowds with tunes from the 1940&#39;s through the 1960&#39;s. Several Warbirds in Review presentations will be followed by book signing opportunities in the Warbirds Merchandise Building.</p><p>&ldquo;July 2017 marks the 15th Anniversary of Warbirds in Review&rdquo; said Connie Bowlin, EAA Warbirds of America president and Warbirds in Review program founder. &ldquo;As I look back on the modest beginning thinking of Tex Hill, Bud Anderson, Robin Olds, Gunther Rall, Shorty Rankin, and so many other World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War, Afghanistan and current military veterans who have been a part of Warbirds in Review, it is humbling. What began with a simple idea, with a boom box and roll around stairs, to offer a time when people could come to hear an owner talk about their aircraft has become a truly world class program. With David Hartman as the writer and moderator, the award winning production crew of Sleeping Dog Productions, the support of Jim Hagedorn, Scotts Miracle Gro Company, Warbird members Ron and Diane Fagen, numerous other donors and the total support of aircraft owners, pilot and ground crew members, we have grown to a level beyond all expectations. The live streaming of Warbirds in Review in 2016 was viewed in 64 countries. &nbsp;For me personally it is a little overwhelming to know that we have entertained and shared our history with the world. &nbsp;With Jumbotron, bleachers, sound systems, worldwide live streaming and the participation of so many terrific Warbird members the evolution has exceeded all expectations.&rdquo;</p><p>L-19, Mohawk &ndash; Vietnam Tribute &ndash; &nbsp;POW Col. William Reeder will be joined by his Army Pilot training classmate, Charlie Finch and Doc Clement who flew together in Vietnam. While Bill Reeder flew combat in the Mohawk and Cobra, Charlie and Doc were flying low level missions in the Bird Dog. The POW experience is described by Col. Reeder in the book &ldquo;Through the Valley&rdquo; and the missions of Charlie and Doc are related in the book &ldquo;A Hundred Feet over Hell&rdquo;. &nbsp;Both books are a must read and will be on sale during autograph session following this presentation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Presentations take place at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. daily, July 24-29 on the Warbirds in Review ramp in Warbird Alley. The schedule also includes daily demonstrations at 9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. from the Warbirds Living History Group on flight gear associated with the upcoming aircraft. Next, vocalist Theresa Eaman will entertain the crowds with tunes from the 1940&#39;s through the 1960&#39;s. Several Warbirds in Review presentations will be followed by book signing opportunities in the Warbirds Merchandise Building.</p><p>&ldquo;July 2017 marks the 15th Anniversary of Warbirds in Review&rdquo; said Connie Bowlin, EAA Warbirds of America president and Warbirds in Review program founder. &ldquo;As I look back on the modest beginning thinking of Tex Hill, Bud Anderson, Robin Olds, Gunther Rall, Shorty Rankin, and so many other World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War, Afghanistan and current military veterans who have been a part of Warbirds in Review, it is humbling. What began with a simple idea, with a boom box and roll around stairs, to offer a time when people could come to hear an owner talk about their aircraft has become a truly world class program. With David Hartman as the writer and moderator, the award winning production crew of Sleeping Dog Productions, the support of Jim Hagedorn, Scotts Miracle Gro Company, Warbird members Ron and Diane Fagen, numerous other donors and the total support of aircraft owners, pilot and ground crew members, we have grown to a level beyond all expectations. The live streaming of Warbirds in Review in 2016 was viewed in 64 countries. &nbsp;For me personally it is a little overwhelming to know that we have entertained and shared our history with the world. &nbsp;With Jumbotron, bleachers, sound systems, worldwide live streaming and the participation of so many terrific Warbird members the evolution has exceeded all expectations.&rdquo;</p><p>B-17 Madras Maiden &ndash; It is a pleasure to welcome Jack Erickson to Oshkosh to talk about one of the many aircraft in the Erickson collection. The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress was used primarily in Europe in the Eighth Air Force. This presentation will focus on the 8th Air Force. At press time plans are pending to include another aircraft to tell this story.</p>",

        "html": "<p>Supermarine Spitfire Mk IX owned by the Collings Foundation.&nbsp;</p><p>History comes to life through legendary wartime aircraft during Warbirds in Review sessions, which delve into aircraft restoration and operation and spotlight veterans sharing stories about what it was like to fly in combat or provide ground support. Presentations take place at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. daily, July 24-29 on the Warbirds in Review ramp in Warbird Alley. The schedule also includes daily demonstrations at 9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. from the Warbirds Living History Group on flight gear associated with the upcoming aircraft. Next, vocalist Theresa Eaman will entertain the crowds with tunes from the 1940&#39;s through the 1960&#39;s. Several Warbirds in Review presentations will be followed by book signing opportunities in the Warbirds Merchandise Building.</p><p>&ldquo;July 2017 marks the 15th Anniversary of Warbirds in Review&rdquo; said Connie Bowlin, EAA Warbirds of America president and Warbirds in Review program founder. &ldquo;As I look back on the modest beginning thinking of Tex Hill, Bud Anderson, Robin Olds, Gunther Rall, Shorty Rankin, and so many other World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War, Afghanistan and current military veterans who have been a part of Warbirds in Review, it is humbling. What began with a simple idea, with a boom box and roll around stairs, to offer a time when people could come to hear an owner talk about their aircraft has become a truly world class program. With David Hartman as the writer and moderator, the award winning production crew of Sleeping Dog Productions, the support of Jim Hagedorn, Scotts Miracle Gro Company, Warbird members Ron and Diane Fagen, numerous other donors and the total support of aircraft owners, pilot and ground crew members, we have grown to a level beyond all expectations. The live streaming of Warbirds in Review in 2016 was viewed in 64 countries. &nbsp;For me personally it is a little overwhelming to know that we have entertained and shared our history with the world. &nbsp;With Jumbotron, bleachers, sound systems, worldwide live streaming and the participation of so many terrific Warbird members the evolution has exceeded all expectations.&rdquo;</p><p>MK IX Spitfire &ndash; Collings Foundation &ndash; There is no other Spitfire in the world that has such an incredible history as this aircraft recently acquired by the Collings Foundation. Legendary pilots and aces flew this Spitfire MK IX BR601 confronting scores of Luftwaffe fighters while flying escort for B-17 and B-24 bombers. The fact that Rob Collings knows descendants of the pilots who flew this aircraft and the uniqueness of this Spitfire will make this really special.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Presentations take place at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. daily, July 24-29 on the Warbirds in Review ramp in Warbird Alley. The schedule also includes daily demonstrations at 9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. from the Warbirds Living History Group on flight gear associated with the upcoming aircraft. Next, vocalist Theresa Eaman will entertain the crowds with tunes from the 1940&#39;s through the 1960&#39;s. Several Warbirds in Review presentations will be followed by book signing opportunities in the Warbirds Merchandise Building.</p><p>&ldquo;July 2017 marks the 15th Anniversary of Warbirds in Review&rdquo; said Connie Bowlin, EAA Warbirds of America president and Warbirds in Review program founder. &ldquo;As I look back on the modest beginning thinking of Tex Hill, Bud Anderson, Robin Olds, Gunther Rall, Shorty Rankin, and so many other World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War, Afghanistan and current military veterans who have been a part of Warbirds in Review, it is humbling. What began with a simple idea, with a boom box and roll around stairs, to offer a time when people could come to hear an owner talk about their aircraft has become a truly world class program. With David Hartman as the writer and moderator, the award winning production crew of Sleeping Dog Productions, the support of Jim Hagedorn, Scotts Miracle Gro Company, Warbird members Ron and Diane Fagen, numerous other donors and the total support of aircraft owners, pilot and ground crew members, we have grown to a level beyond all expectations. The live streaming of Warbirds in Review in 2016 was viewed in 64 countries. &nbsp;For me personally it is a little overwhelming to know that we have entertained and shared our history with the world. &nbsp;With Jumbotron, bleachers, sound systems, worldwide live streaming and the participation of so many terrific Warbird members the evolution has exceeded all expectations.&rdquo;</p><p>B-25 &ndash; 75th Anniversary Doolittle Raid &ndash; Col. Dick Cole at the young age of 101 will share his experiences as Jimmy Doolittle&rsquo;s co-pilot on one of the most significant missions in our history. &nbsp;As Col Cole speaks in front of the B-25 owned by Larry Kelley there will be a display of B-25s on Warbird Alley that will replicate the deck of the Hornet on that day in April 1942 when they made history. Colonel Cole will be joined by Jimmy Doolittle, III and Jonna Doolittle.</p>",

During layovers, he&#39;d write thank you notes on the back of his business cards for the next flight, adding passenger names from the manifest after boarding. &ldquo;I&#39;d ask the FA to give out 50 cards to first class, and those in middle seats in coach.

His almost magical way of getting important information across to diverse audiences, captivating them with real and funny examples. He was an early developer of CRM, in 1977 and gives safety talks at military, aviation, utility, medical, and EMS events.

Hear about what it was like on some of these incredible first test flights of experimental aircraft Dick agreed to fly. You&rsquo;ll be shaking your head in astonishment. Of course, with Dick&#39;s unique wit, he will soon have everyone laughing too. Kick it up with Dick Rutan and you&#39;ll soon learn why some call him the Indiana Jones of Aviation.
